# Music-Recommendation-Model
This report aims to develop a recommendation system for the KKBox music streaming service. The dataset is retrieved from [KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge). KKBox, recognized as Asia’s leading music streaming platform, boasts a vast library comprising over 30 million tracks, predominantly in the Asia-Pop genre. While currently employing a collaborative filtering-based algorithm with matrix factorization and word embedding techniques in their recommendation system, there is a belief that integrating new methodologies could yield superior results.

The project unfolds through various stages, beginning with data preparation tasks, including data loading, merging dataframes and data cleaning. Subsequently, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to glean insights into user demographics, song preferences, and the overall performance of the KKBox system. In this part, we will use visualizations to better illustrate some characteristics related to app users such as Users\’ age distribution, gender demographics, others related to songs like popular artists, and the geographical distribution of song plays.

The focal point of the project lies in constructing a music recommender system with classification methods. To ascertain the optimal model, we evaluate four distinct models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Each model undergoes a process of hyperparameter tuning to enhance its performance. Subsequently, we compare the accuracies of these models and select the one with the highest accuracy. Additionally, we conduct a feature importance analysis to discern the significant contributors to the overall model performance.
